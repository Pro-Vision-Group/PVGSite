# Build vs. Buy

It's the question every growing business hits eventually. You need a system — an ERP, a CRM, a fleet tracker, an internal tool — and someone on the team says "let's just use Salesforce" while someone else says "let's build it ourselves."

Both are right. Both are wrong. The answer depends entirely on context, and after building custom systems alongside deploying off-the-shelf platforms for companies across the UAE, we've developed a reliable framework for making the call.

## The Real Cost of "Buying"

SaaS pricing is deceptively simple. $50/user/month sounds cheap until you do the math:

```
50 users × $50/month × 12 months = $30,000/year

But then add:
  Premium tier (you'll need it)       +40%
  API access add-on                   +$200/mo
  Integration middleware (Zapier etc.) +$500/mo
  Custom reports add-on               +$150/mo
  SSO / security compliance           +$300/mo
  Admin training & onboarding         +$5,000

Year 1 actual cost:                   ~$60,000
Year 2 (with growth):                 ~$85,000
Year 3:                               ~$110,000
```

Over three years, that "$50/user/month" tool costs you $255,000 — and you still don't own anything. Cancel the subscription and your data is trapped in someone else's export format.

This doesn't mean buying is always wrong. It means the comparison needs to be honest.

## When Buying Makes Sense

Off-the-shelf wins when:

- **The problem is generic.** Payroll, email, accounting, video conferencing — these are solved problems. You gain nothing from reinventing them.
- **You need it yesterday.** If speed to deployment matters more than fit, a 70% solution today beats a 100% solution in six months.
- **The vendor's roadmap aligns with yours.** If they're investing in features you'll need, you're effectively getting free R&D.
- **Your process can adapt to the tool.** Some teams are flexible enough to change how they work to match the software. If that's you, buying saves time.

## When Building Makes Sense

Custom development wins when:

- **The process is your competitive advantage.** If the way you handle client onboarding, project delivery, or procurement is what sets you apart — don't flatten it into someone else's workflow.
- **Integration is the core problem.** When you need five systems talking to each other in real-time, the middleware to connect off-the-shelf tools often costs more than building one unified system.
- **You're outgrowing the tool.** The classic sign: your team spends more time working around the software than working with it. Spreadsheets patching gaps. Manual exports. Copy-paste between tabs.
- **Data control is critical.** Regulated industries, government contracts, or sensitive IP — sometimes the data simply cannot live on a third-party server you don't control.

## Our Decision Framework

We walk clients through four questions:

| Question | If Yes → Buy | If Yes → Build |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Is this a commodity process? | The process is standard across industries | The process is unique to your business |
| Will it change frequently? | Requirements are stable and well-understood | Requirements evolve as the business grows |
| How many systems does it touch? | It's standalone or has standard integrations | It needs deep integration with 3+ internal systems |
| What's the 3-year total cost? | SaaS TCO is under custom dev cost | Custom dev TCO is under SaaS TCO including workarounds |

If you get a split — two "buy" answers and two "build" answers — that's usually a signal to start with a focused custom build for the core workflow and integrate off-the-shelf tools for the periphery.

## The Hybrid Approach

In practice, the best systems we've delivered are hybrids:

- **Custom-built core** — the workflow engine, dashboards, and business logic that make the company run
- **Off-the-shelf integrations** — Stripe for payments, Twilio for SMS, QuickBooks for accounting, Auth0 for authentication
- **Standard protocols** — REST APIs, webhooks, and event-driven architecture so the custom and off-the-shelf components communicate cleanly

This gives you ownership where it matters and leverage where it doesn't.

## How to Start

If you're stuck in the build-vs-buy debate, here's what we recommend:

1. **Map the actual workflow.** Not the idealized version — the real one, with all the workarounds and spreadsheets.
2. **Price the SaaS option honestly.** Include every add-on, integration cost, and training expense over three years.
3. **Get a custom estimate.** A good development partner can scope a focused build in a week.
4. **Compare total cost of ownership**, not sticker price.

The answer is usually clearer than you'd expect once you lay the numbers side by side.

At Pro Vision Solutions, we've done both — deployed off-the-shelf platforms and built custom systems from scratch. We don't have a bias toward either. We have a bias toward the option that delivers the most value for your specific situation. [Let's figure it out together](/solutions#contact).
