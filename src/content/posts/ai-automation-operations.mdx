# AI in Operations

Every vendor pitch in 2026 includes the words "AI-powered." Most of them shouldn't. The reality is that AI delivers enormous value in a narrow set of operational use cases — and is a waste of money in everything else.

After deploying AI-driven automation across logistics, construction, and professional services companies in the UAE, we've developed a clear picture of where it works and where it doesn't.

## Where AI Actually Delivers

### Document Processing

This is the single highest-ROI use case we've seen. Companies processing invoices, purchase orders, contracts, or compliance documents manually are leaving money on the table.

A typical mid-size company processes 500–2,000 documents per month. Each one requires:
- Manual data entry (5–15 minutes)
- Verification against existing records (5–10 minutes)
- Routing for approval (variable, often days)

With AI-powered document extraction and classification:

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Processing time per document | 15–25 min | 30 seconds |
| Error rate | 3–5% | Under 0.5% |
| Staff hours per month | 250–500 hrs | 15–30 hrs |
| Cost per document | AED 12–20 | AED 0.50–1.50 |

The technology isn't exotic — OCR combined with large language models for extraction, rules-based validation, and workflow automation for routing. The value comes from the integration, not the algorithm.

### Predictive Maintenance

For companies with physical assets — fleet vehicles, construction equipment, HVAC systems — predictive maintenance powered by sensor data and ML models consistently reduces unplanned downtime by 30–50%.

The approach:
1. Instrument assets with IoT sensors (vibration, temperature, usage hours)
2. Collect baseline data for 60–90 days
3. Train anomaly detection models on normal operating patterns
4. Alert maintenance teams before failures occur

The math works because a single unexpected equipment failure on a construction site can cost AED 50,000–200,000 in project delays. A sensor costs AED 500.

### Demand Forecasting

Retail, distribution, and service businesses that rely on inventory or staffing decisions benefit significantly from ML-based forecasting. The models ingest historical sales data, seasonal patterns, external factors (weather, events, holidays), and produce forecasts that consistently outperform spreadsheet-based planning by 20–35%.

## Where AI Doesn't Deliver

### "Smart" Chatbots for Complex Queries

If your customer inquiries require nuance, judgment, or access to real-time account data across multiple systems — a chatbot will frustrate more customers than it helps. We've seen companies spend AED 200,000+ on conversational AI that handles 15% of inquiries and escalates the rest.

Better approach: invest in a good knowledge base and streamline the human response workflow.

### AI-Generated Content at Scale

Generating marketing copy, social posts, or reports with AI is fast but produces generic output that damages brand voice over time. Use AI as a drafting assistant, not a replacement for human judgment on anything customer-facing.

### "AI Strategy" Without Data Infrastructure

We regularly meet companies that want to "implement AI" but don't have clean, centralized data. You can't build ML models on spreadsheets scattered across 12 departments. Fix the data layer first. AI comes after.

## Our Evaluation Framework

Before recommending AI for any process, we ask four questions:

1. **Is the task repetitive and rule-based?** If yes, AI can likely automate it. If it requires creative judgment, probably not.
2. **Is there enough data?** Most models need thousands of examples to be useful. If you process 20 invoices a month, a template and a macro will outperform any AI system.
3. **What's the cost of errors?** AI is probabilistic — it will get things wrong sometimes. If a 1% error rate is acceptable, great. If errors have legal or safety implications, you need a human in the loop.
4. **What's the payback period?** If the automation doesn't pay for itself within 12 months, the business case is weak.

## Start Small, Prove Value, Scale

The companies that get the most from AI are the ones that start with a single, well-scoped use case, measure the results rigorously, and then expand. The ones that fail are the ones that launch an "AI transformation initiative" across the entire organization.

Pick one process. Automate it. Measure the ROI. Then decide what's next.
